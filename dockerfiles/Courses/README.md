This is the Course docker file folder.  

Here has 3 kinds of courses, CV, DL, LLM. 
CV and DL are recommended to run on dGPUs, and LLM is suggested to run on 395.

Upon buiding, the scripts inside each folder will copy related notebooks from `projects`, download neccessary files,
and build then push the image.

Course images remain notebook and course focused. Browser coding environments are built from the separate generic code image line in `dockerfiles/Code/` as `auplc-code-cpu` and `auplc-code-gpu`; do not create per-course VS Code image variants such as course-specific code-server images.

Use the existing course target for course notebook images:

```bash
make -C dockerfiles courses GPU_TARGET=gfx1151
```

Course resources should land on their course content. Set each official course
resource's `custom.resources.metadata.<resource>.defaultPath` to the same path as
the image `WORKDIR`, such as `/opt/workspace/CV`. The official image contract
verifier checks that metadata and image contract:

```bash
make -C dockerfiles verify-resource-contracts
```

The verifier is for official images. At runtime, the Hub doesn't check whether a
configured path exists in arbitrary or custom images. Custom course images must
create their configured landing path themselves. For non-official images that
already declare the desired Docker `WORKDIR`, omit `defaultPath` to preserve the
image's initial folder.

Use the code targets only for generic code-server environments:

```bash
make -C dockerfiles code-cpu
make -C dockerfiles code-gpu GPU_TARGET=gfx1151
make -C dockerfiles code
```
